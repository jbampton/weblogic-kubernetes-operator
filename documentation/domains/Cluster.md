### Cluster

A Cluster resource describes the lifecycle options for all of the Managed Server members of a WebLogic cluster, including Java options, environment variables, additional Pod content, and the ability to explicitly start, stop, or restart cluster members. It must describe a cluster that already exists in the WebLogic domain configuration. See also `domain.spec.clusters`.

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `apiVersion` | string | The API version defines the versioned schema of this cluster. |
| `kind` | string | The type of the REST resource. Must be "Cluster". |
| `metadata` | [Object Meta](k8s1.13.5.md#object-meta) | The resource metadata. Must include the `name` and `namespace. |
| `spec` | [Cluster Spec](#cluster-spec) | The specification of the operation of the WebLogic cluster. Required. |
| `status` | [Cluster Status](#cluster-status) | The current status of the operation of the WebLogic cluster. Updated automatically by the operator. |

### Cluster Spec

The specification of the operation of the WebLogic cluster. Required.

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `clusterName` | string | The name of the cluster. This value must match the name of a WebLogic cluster already defined in the WebLogic domain configuration. Required. |
| `clusterService` | [Cluster Service](#cluster-service) | Customization affecting Kubernetes Service generated for this WebLogic cluster. |
| `maxConcurrentShutdown` | integer | The maximum number of WebLogic Server instances that will shut down in parallel for this cluster when it is being partially shut down by lowering its replica count. A value of 0 means there is no limit. Defaults to `spec.maxClusterConcurrentShutdown`, which defaults to 1. |
| `maxConcurrentStartup` | integer | The maximum number of Managed Servers instances that the operator will start in parallel for this cluster in response to a change in the `replicas` count. If more Managed Server instances must be started, the operator will wait until a Managed Server Pod is in the `Ready` state before starting the next Managed Server instance. A value of 0 means all Managed Server instances will start in parallel. Defaults to `domain.spec.maxClusterConcurrentStartup`, which defaults to 0. |
| `maxUnavailable` | integer | The maximum number of cluster members that can be temporarily unavailable. Defaults to `domain.spec.maxClusterUnavailable`, which defaults to 1. |
| `replicas` | integer | The number of cluster member Managed Server instances to start for this WebLogic cluster. The operator will sort cluster member Managed Server names from the WebLogic domain configuration by normalizing any numbers in the Managed Server name and then sorting alphabetically. This is done so that server names such as "managed-server10" come after "managed-server9". The operator will then start Managed Server instances from the sorted list, up to the `replicas` count, unless specific Managed Servers are specified as starting in their entry under the `managedServers` field. In that case, the specified Managed Server instances will be started and then additional cluster members will be started, up to the `replicas` count, by finding further cluster members in the sorted list that are not already started. If cluster members are started because of their related entries under `managedServers`, then this cluster may have more cluster members running than its `replicas` count. Defaults to `domain.spec.replicas`, which defaults 1. |
| `restartVersion` | string | Changes to this field cause the operator to restart WebLogic Server instances. More info: https://oracle.github.io/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/userguide/managing-domains/domain-lifecycle/startup/#restarting-servers. |
| `serverPod` | [Server Pod](#server-pod) | Customization affecting the generation of Pods for WebLogic Server instances. |
| `serverService` | [Server Service](#server-service) | Customization affecting the generation of ClusterIP Services for WebLogic Server instances. |
| `serverStartPolicy` | string | The strategy for deciding whether to start a WebLogic Server instance. Legal values are `Never`, or `IfNeeded`. Defaults to `IfNeeded`.

### V 1 Topology Spread Constraint

TopologySpreadConstraint specifies how to spread matching pods among the given topology.

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `labelSelector` | [Label Selector](k8s1.13.5.md#label-selector) | A label selector is a label query over a set of resources. The result of matchLabels and matchExpressions are ANDed. An empty label selector matches all objects. A null label selector matches no objects. |
| `matchLabelKeys` | Array of string | MatchLabelKeys is a set of pod label keys to select the pods over which spreading will be calculated. The keys are used to lookup values from the incoming pod labels, those key-value labels are ANDed with labelSelector to select the group of existing pods over which spreading will be calculated for the incoming pod. Keys that don't exist in the incoming pod labels will be ignored. A null or empty list means only match against labelSelector. |
| `maxSkew` | integer | MaxSkew describes the degree to which pods may be unevenly distributed. When `whenUnsatisfiable=DoNotSchedule`, it is the maximum permitted difference between the number of matching pods in the target topology and the global minimum. The global minimum is the minimum number of matching pods in an eligible domain or zero if the number of eligible domains is less than MinDomains. For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same labelSelector spread as 2/2/1: In this case, the global minimum is 1. | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 | |  P P  |  P P  |   P   | - if MaxSkew is 1, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone3 to become 2/2/2; scheduling it onto zone1(zone2) would make the ActualSkew(3-1) on zone1(zone2) violate MaxSkew(1). - if MaxSkew is 2, incoming pod can be scheduled onto any zone. When `whenUnsatisfiable=ScheduleAnyway`, it is used to give higher precedence to topologies that satisfy it. It's a required field. Default value is 1 and 0 is not allowed. |
| `minDomains` | integer | MinDomains indicates a minimum number of eligible domains. When the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys is less than minDomains, Pod Topology Spread treats "global minimum" as 0, and then the calculation of Skew is performed. And when the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys equals or greater than minDomains, this value has no effect on scheduling. As a result, when the number of eligible domains is less than minDomains, scheduler won't schedule more than maxSkew Pods to those domains. If value is nil, the constraint behaves as if MinDomains is equal to 1. Valid values are integers greater than 0. When value is not nil, WhenUnsatisfiable must be DoNotSchedule.  For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 2, MinDomains is set to 5 and pods with the same labelSelector spread as 2/2/2: | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 | |  P P  |  P P  |  P P  | The number of domains is less than 5(MinDomains), so "global minimum" is treated as 0. In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector cannot be scheduled, because computed skew will be 3(3 - 0) if new Pod is scheduled to any of the three zones, it will violate MaxSkew.  This is a beta field and requires the MinDomainsInPodTopologySpread feature gate to be enabled (enabled by default). |
| `nodeAffinityPolicy` | string | NodeAffinityPolicy indicates how we will treat Pod's nodeAffinity/nodeSelector when calculating pod topology spread skew. Options are: - Honor: only nodes matching nodeAffinity/nodeSelector are included in the calculations. - Ignore: nodeAffinity/nodeSelector are ignored. All nodes are included in the calculations.  If this value is nil, the behavior is equivalent to the Honor policy. This is a alpha-level feature enabled by the NodeInclusionPolicyInPodTopologySpread feature flag. |
| `nodeTaintsPolicy` | string | NodeTaintsPolicy indicates how we will treat node taints when calculating pod topology spread skew. Options are: - Honor: nodes without taints, along with tainted nodes for which the incoming pod has a toleration, are included. - Ignore: node taints are ignored. All nodes are included.  If this value is nil, the behavior is equivalent to the Ignore policy. This is a alpha-level feature enabled by the NodeInclusionPolicyInPodTopologySpread feature flag. |
| `topologyKey` | string | TopologyKey is the key of node labels. Nodes that have a label with this key and identical values are considered to be in the same topology. We consider each <key, value> as a "bucket", and try to put balanced number of pods into each bucket. We define a domain as a particular instance of a topology. Also, we define an eligible domain as a domain whose nodes meet the requirements of nodeAffinityPolicy and nodeTaintsPolicy. e.g. If TopologyKey is "kubernetes.io/hostname", each Node is a domain of that topology. And, if TopologyKey is "topology.kubernetes.io/zone", each zone is a domain of that topology. It's a required field. |
| `whenUnsatisfiable` | string | WhenUnsatisfiable indicates how to deal with a pod if it doesn't satisfy the spread constraint. - DoNotSchedule (default) tells the scheduler not to schedule it. - ScheduleAnyway tells the scheduler to schedule the pod in any location,   but giving higher precedence to topologies that would help reduce the   skew. A constraint is considered "Unsatisfiable" for an incoming pod if and only if every possible node assignment for that pod would violate "MaxSkew" on some topology. For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same labelSelector spread as 3/1/1: | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 | | P P P |   P   |   P   | If WhenUnsatisfiable is set to DoNotSchedule, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone2(zone3) to become 3/2/1(3/1/2) as ActualSkew(2-1) on zone2(zone3) satisfies MaxSkew(1). In other words, the cluster can still be imbalanced, but scheduler won't make it *more* imbalanced. It's a required field.   |
