Introduction
------------

This directory contains standalone 'wrapper' scripts for automating the domain-on-pv sample. These scripts are NOT part of the sample - they're used by the test framework to encapsulate and automate testing of the sample, and they're used by a local 'generate' script to generate commands and yaml for the sample source and documentation.

When modifying these scripts, make sure (a) the test programs that depend on them continue to work, (b) that you try not to add dependencies on any test framework.

Globals & Defaults
------------------

WORKDIR ::: sample/target directory
  Default '/tmp/$USER/domain-on-pv-sample-work-dir'.

DOMAIN_UID ::: Domain UID
  Default 'sample-domain1'. 

DOMAIN_NAMESPACE ::: Domain Namespace
  Default is 'sample-domain1-ns'.

IMAGE_PULL_POLICY ::: Image Pull Policy
  Default is 'IfNotPresent'.

CUSTOM_DOMAIN_NAME ::: WebLogic Domain Name
  This is the configured WebLogic domain name (not the domain UID). The domain
  name is set at runtime using an '@@ENV:CUSTOM_DOMAIN_NAME@@' model macro in
  the model image's model files staged by 'stage-model-image.sh'. The
  environment variable is passed to the model at runtime by the domain resource
  that's generated by 'stage-domain-resource.sh'. Default is 'domain1'.

WDT_DOMAIN_TYPE ::: WDT domain type.
  Set to 'WLS' (default) for a standard WLS domain, 'RestrictedJRF', or 'JRF. 
  This value is used by './build-wdt-domain-image.sh' as a WIT parameter and
  also to help choose the base image default. It's also used by 
  './stage-domain-resource.sh' to set the 'configuration.model.domainType'
  domain resource field.

BASE_IMAGE_NAME ::: Base image name.
  Defaults to 'container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/weblogic' for the 
  'WLS' WDT_DOMAIN_TYPE, and otherwise defaults to 
  'container-registry.oracle.com/middleware/fmw-infrastructure'.

BASE_IMAGE_TAG ::: Base image tag.
  Defaults to 12.2.1.4.

DOMAIN_CREATION_IMAGE_BUILD ::: When to build domain creation image.
  Set to 'when-missing' (default) to tell './build-wdt-domain-image.sh' to skip
  building a model image when DOMAIN_CREATION_IMAGE_NAME:DOMAIN_CREATION_IMAGE_TAG already
  exists in your docker image cache. Set to 'always' to always build.

DOMAIN_CREATION_IMAGE_NAME ::: Domain creation image name.
  Used for the model image that's generated by './build-wdt-domain-image.sh', 
  and also by the './stage-domain-resource.sh' script to set the
  domain resource 'spec.configuration.initializeDomainOnPV.domain.domainCreationImages' setting. 
  Defaults to 'wdt-domain-image'.

IMAGE_PULL_SECRET_NAME ::: Image pull secret name.
  If set, uncomments domain resource image pull secret stanza and sets
  the secret to the specified value.
  If not set or empty string, defaults the domain resource 
  to a commented out image pull stanza with 'regsecret'

IMAGE_TYPE ::: Domain creation image type.
  Defaults to $WDT_DOMAIN_TYPE for a standard WLS domain, or 'JRF'.
  This value is used when selecting the domain resource template, to create the value of
  the DOMAIN_CREATION_IMAGE_TAG environment variable and in generate-sample-doc.sh when setting up
  the domain resource path. See WDT_DOMAIN_TYPE for more info.

DOMAIN_CREATION_IMAGE_TAG ::: Domain creation image tag.
  Defaults to 'IMAGE_TYPE-v1'. See IMAGE_TYPE and DOMAIN_CREATION_IMAGE_NAME for more info.

MODEL_DIR ::: Location of staged model files for the model image relative to WORKDIR.
  Location of staged model .zip, .properties, and .yaml files that are
  copied into the model image by the './build-wdt-domain-image.sh' script.
  Default is:
   'wdt-artifacts/wdt-model-files/${DOMAIN_CREATION_IMAGE_TAG}'

ARCHIVE_SOURCEDIR ::: Location of archive source dir for the model image relative to WORKDIR
  This is used to create $MODEL_DIR/archive.zip and must
  contain a 'wlsdeploy' directory. Defaults to 'wdt-artifacts/archives/archive-v1'.

INCLUDE_DOMAIN_CREATION_CONFIGMAP ::: Tell sample to include a configuration.model.configMap
  Used by './stage-domain-resource.sh' to add a reference to a configMap
  in the domain resource, and to add a configuration.model.secrets reference
  to a secret that's used by the configMap. Also used by './create-secrets.sh' to
  deploy a secret the configMap uses. 
  Valid values are 'false' (default), and 'true'.

http_proxy https_proxy ::: Proxies
  If running behind a proxy, then set as needed to allow curl access
  to github.com. Used by 'stage-tooling.sh'.

DOWNLOAD_WDT ::: When to download the WDT installer zip.
  Set to 'always' to always download WDT even if WORKDIR already has 
  a download, default is 'when-missing'. Used by './stage-tooling.sh'.

WDT_INSTALLER_URL ::: WDT installer URL
  Used by './stage-tooling.sh' to obtain the WDT installer.
  Set to a specific zip loc to download specific version, for example:
   'https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-deploy-tooling/releases/download/release-1.9.7/weblogic-deploy.zip'
  TBD before releasing 3.0, update example version above to correspond to latest and greatest version - and/or point to where we document the supported version
  Defaults to 'https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-deploy-tooling/releases/latest'

DOWNLOAD_WIT ::: When to download the WIT installer zip.
  Set to 'always' to always download WIT even if WORKDIR already has 
  a download, default is 'when-missing'. Used by './stage-tooling.sh'.

WIT_INSTALLER_URL ::: WIT installer URL
  Used by './stage-tooling.sh' to obtain the WIT installer.
  Set to zip loc to download specific version, for example:
   'https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-image-tool/releases/download/release-1.9.5/imagetool.zip'
  Defaults to 'https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-image-tool/releases/latest'

DOMAIN_RESOURCE_TEMPLATE ::: Domain resource template
  Used by './stage-domain-resource.sh' as a template for generating a domain
  resource yaml files in WORKDIR. Relative to SCRIPTDIR. Defaults to 
  'dpv-domain.yaml.template-WDT_DOMAIN_TYPE'

DOMAIN_RESOURCE_FILENAME ::: Domain resource filename
  Used by './stage-domain-resource.sh' as a target for generating a domain
  resource yaml file in WORKDIR. Relative to WORKDIR. Defaults to 
  'domain-resources/dpv-DOMAIN_UID.yaml'

INTROSPECTOR_DEADLINE_SECONDS ::: Introspector timeout for WLS and JRF runs
  Defaults to 300 for WLS domain and 1800 for JRF domains.

DB_NAMESPACE ::: Namespace for Oracle DB

DB_NODEPORT ::: NodePort for Oracle DB

AUXILIARY_IMAGE_PATH ::: The auxiliary image path
  The path to copy the Domain on PV model files and WDT installation files in the domain creation image.
  Defaults to '/auxiliary'.

DOMAIN_CREATION_IMAGE_DOCKER_FILE_SOURCEDIR ::: Source dir for the docker file.
  Source dir for Dockerfile (relative to WORKDIR) for creating domain creation image containing model
  files and WDT installation. Defaults to 'dci-docker-file'.
