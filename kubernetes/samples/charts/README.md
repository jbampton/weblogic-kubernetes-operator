# WebLogic Kubernetes Operator Load Balancer Samples

## Load balancer sample scripts

The WebLogic Kubernetes Operator supports three load balancers: Traefik, NGINX, and Apache. We provide samples that demonstrate how to install and configure each one. The samples are located in following folders:

* [traefik](traefik/README.md)
* [NGINX](nginx/README.md)
* [ingress-per-domain](ingress-per-domain/README.md)
