      <description>This documentation uses several important terms which are intended to have a specific meaning.&#xA;Term Definition Cluster Because this term is ambiguous, it will be prefixed to indicate which type of cluster is meant. A WebLogic cluster is a group of WebLogic Managed Servers that together host some application or component and which are able to share load and state between them; a single WebLogic domain can define multiple WebLogic clusters.</description>

      <description>The WebLogic Kubernetes Operator (the “operator”) is designed to fulfill a similar role to that which a human operator would fill in a traditional data center deployment. It contains a set of useful built-in knowledge about how to perform various life cycle operations on a domain correctly.&#xA;Human operators are typically responsible for starting and stopping environments, performing scaling operations, performing manual tasks associated with disaster recovery and high availability needs and coordinating actions with other operators in other data centers.</description>
